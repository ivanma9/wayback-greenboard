# Technical Write-up: Greenboard Web Archiver

## Architecture Decisions & Trade-offs

### 1. **Storage Strategy: File-based vs Database**

**Decision:** File-based storage with JSON metadata and HTML files

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ **Pros:** Simple deployment, no database setup, portable archives, easy backup/restore
- ❌ **Cons:** No ACID transactions, limited querying, potential file system limitations

**Rationale:** Chose simplicity and portability over complex database management. File-based storage makes the tool easy to deploy and archive data is naturally portable.

### 2. **Multi-page Crawling: Concurrent vs Sequential**

**Decision:** Concurrent batch processing with configurable concurrency

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ **Pros:** Significantly faster archiving (5x+ throughput), better resource utilization
- ❌ **Cons:** Higher memory usage, potential for overwhelming target servers

**Implementation:** Configurable concurrency (default: 5) with request delays to be respectful. Performance metrics show ~2-3 pages/second throughput.

### 3. **Asset Handling: Download vs Link**

**Decision:** Optional asset downloading with user-controlled toggle

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ **Pros:** Complete offline viewing when enabled, local asset paths for reliability
- ❌ **Cons:** Slower archiving, larger storage footprint, potential copyright issues

**Rationale:** User choice balances completeness vs. performance. Default behavior (assets disabled) prioritizes speed and storage efficiency.

### 4. **Web Scraping Strategy: Single vs Multi-approach**

**Decision:** Three-tier fallback strategy (Standard → Referer → Mobile User Agent)

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ **Pros:** High success rate across different sites, robust against anti-bot measures
- ❌ **Cons:** Slower for sites that work with first attempt, more complex error handling

**Results:** Successfully archives sites like Apple.com, Nike.com, Adidas.com that have sophisticated anti-bot measures.

### 5. **Path Resolution: Metadata vs Sitemap**

**Decision:** Sitemap-based path matching with metadata fallback

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ **Pros:** Accurate URL-to-file mapping, handles trailing slashes correctly
- ❌ **Cons:** Additional file to maintain, slightly more complex logic

**Implementation:** Sitemap.json provides exact file mapping, enabling precise path resolution for archived content.

### 6. **HTML Processing: Sanitization vs Preservation**

**Decision:** Aggressive sanitization (remove scripts, redirects, problematic elements)

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ **Pros:** Eliminates client-side redirects, prevents security issues, consistent viewing
- ❌ **Cons:** Some dynamic functionality lost, may break certain sites

**Rationale:** Prioritized reliable offline viewing over preserving potentially problematic JavaScript functionality.

## What I Would Do Differently with More Time

### 1. **Database Integration**
- Implement PostgreSQL for metadata storage with full-text search

- Add image optimization and compression
- Support for more asset types (fonts, videos, etc.)

### 3. **Enhanced Crawling Intelligence**
- Implement robots.txt compliance
- Add rate limiting and polite crawling
- Support for authentication and session handling
- Intelligent depth-first vs breadth-first crawling based on site structure

### 4. **Better Error Handling & Recovery**
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Add partial archive recovery from failures
- Better error categorization and reporting

### 5. **User Interface Improvements**
- Real-time progress indicators during archiving
- Archive preview and thumbnail generation
- Advanced filtering and search within archives
- Export functionality (PDF, single HTML file)

### 6. **Performance Optimizations**
- Implement streaming responses for large archives
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed content
- Optimize memory usage for large-scale archiving
- Add background job processing for long-running archives

## Production Scaling Strategy

### 1. **Infrastructure Scaling**

**Horizontal Scaling:**
- Deploy multiple instances behind load balancer
- Use Redis for session management and caching
- Implement CDN for static asset delivery
- Add database clustering for metadata storage

**Vertical Scaling:**
- Increase server resources (CPU, RAM, storage)
- Implement connection pooling for database
- Add SSD storage for better I/O performance

### 2. **Storage Architecture**

**Distributed Storage:**
- Move to S3-compatible object storage for archive files
- Implement storage tiering (hot/cold storage)
- Add data compression and deduplication
- Implement backup and disaster recovery

**Database Scaling:**
- PostgreSQL with read replicas for metadata
- Implement database sharding for large datasets
- Add full-text search with Elasticsearch

### 3. **Performance Optimizations**

**Caching Strategy:**
- Redis for session and metadata caching
- CDN for static assets and archived content
- Browser caching with appropriate headers
- Implement cache warming for popular archives

**Concurrency Management:**
- Implement job queue (Redis/Bull) for archiving tasks
- Add worker processes for background processing
- Implement rate limiting per domain/IP
- Add circuit breakers for external requests

### 4. **Monitoring & Observability**

**Application Monitoring:**
- Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
- Add metrics collection (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Set up alerting for failures and performance issues
- Add distributed tracing for request flows

**Business Metrics:**
- Track archive success rates by domain
- Monitor storage usage and growth
- Measure user engagement and archive access patterns
- Implement cost tracking and optimization

### 5. **Security & Compliance**

**Security Measures:**
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Add rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Implement content scanning for malware
- Add audit logging for all operations

**Legal Compliance:**
- Implement robots.txt compliance
- Add copyright and terms of service checking
- Implement data retention policies
- Add GDPR/privacy compliance features

### 6. **API & Integration**

**RESTful API:**
- Implement comprehensive REST API
- Add API rate limiting and authentication
- Provide SDKs for popular languages
- Add webhook support for archive events

**Third-party Integrations:**
- Add export to Wayback Machine
- Implement integration with archive.org
- Add support for various storage backends
- Enable integration with content management systems

## Technical Debt & Maintenance

### Current Technical Debt:
1. **Error Handling:** Inconsistent error handling across modules
2. **Testing:** Limited unit and integration tests
3. **Configuration:** Hard-coded values that should be configurable
4. **Documentation:** API documentation needs improvement
5. **Code Organization:** Some functions are too large and need refactoring

### Maintenance Priorities:
1. **Add comprehensive testing suite**
2. **Implement configuration management**
3. **Add API documentation**
4. **Refactor large functions into smaller, testable units**
5. **Add monitoring and alerting**

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for web archiving with good performance and reliability. The file-based approach makes it easy to deploy and use, while the concurrent processing and multi-strategy scraping provide robust functionality.

For production use, the focus should be on:
1. **Infrastructure scaling** with proper monitoring
2. **Database integration** for better data management
3. **Enhanced security** and compliance features
4. **Comprehensive testing** and documentation
5. **Performance optimization** for large-scale operations

The modular architecture makes it relatively straightforward to implement these improvements incrementally without major rewrites.
